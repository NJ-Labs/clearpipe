# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability in ClearPipe, please email us directly instead of using the public issue tracker.

**Please do not disclose security vulnerabilities publicly.**

### How to Report

Send an email to the project maintainers with:

1. A description of the vulnerability
2. Steps to reproduce (if applicable)
3. Potential impact
4. Suggested fix (if you have one)

We will:

- Acknowledge receipt of your report within 48 hours
- Provide an estimated timeline for a fix
- Keep you informed of our progress
- Credit you in the security advisory (if you wish)

## Supported Versions

We provide security updates for the following versions:

| Version | Supported          |
